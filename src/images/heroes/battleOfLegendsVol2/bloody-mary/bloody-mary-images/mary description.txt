Bloody Mary didn't first appear in this movie. Bloody Mary has been thought to be the ghost of Queen Mary, or some other legend associated with the myth. According to legend, people can make Bloody Mary appear in a mirror if somebody does this:

Go into a bathroom and and turn off all the lights in front of the mirror.
Say "Bloody Mary" 3 times in a row.
Turn lights back on, only to see Bloody Mary standing behind you. If you don't get out of the way, she will kill you and disappear.
